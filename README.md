Magento jQuery Include
======================

The purpose of this module is to load your own jQuery library before the prototype.js library, to avoid conflicts. This extension was developed using Magento 1.7.0.2 - beware using this on earlier or later versions.

To enable go to <strong>System > Configuration > Design > HTML Head</strong>

To disable the entire module simply go to <strong>app/etc/modules/Creare_Jqueryinclude.xml</strong> and set <i>&lt;active&gt;false&lt;/active&gt;<i>.
